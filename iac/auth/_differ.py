    Determines whether `_new` will cause a change if applied as a patch to `_old`.

    Patch Rules:
    1. `_new` is a patch â€“ only keys present in `_new` are checked. Keys missing in `_new` are ignored (not compared).
    3. If a key in `_new` has a falsy value (None, False, "", [], {}), it will cause a patch if:
       - The key does exist in `_old` but contains a truthy value.
       - If the key does not exist in `_old`, it does NOT trigger a patch.
    4. If `_new` has a non-falsy value, `_old` must either:
       - Contain the same value (no patch needed).
       - Contain a different value (patch needed).
    5. Nested structures (dicts/lists) are compared recursively.

    :param _new: The patch/update (dict, list, or value).
    :param _old: The original structure (dict, list, or value).
    :return: True if `_new` will cause a patch, False otherwise
