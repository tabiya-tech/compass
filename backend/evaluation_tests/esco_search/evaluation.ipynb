    "## Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to evaluate the vector search component of our RAG model. In order to do so, we consider two pre-processed datasets respectively for job and skills data. The first one contains 552 job titles, descriptions and synthetic queries that a Brujula user might submit to the platform, as well as a ground truth ESCO code for occupation and its related essential skills, contained as a list of Tabiya UUIDs for skills. Further information can be found in the [Hahu test Huggingface repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tabiya/hahu_test). The second dataset contains 1054 sentences with multiple skills (2013 in total) which are extracted from job description requirements. In this case, we also generated a synthetic query for the test input to match closer our use case. Further information can be found in the [Skill test set Huggingface repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tabiya/esco_skills_test). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set an evaluation target, let us consider our downstream application. In fact, the ESCO nodes found by our vector search will be used to build a prompt so that the Large Language Model can ask users to validate a number of skills and occupations found through vector search. Because of this two step process, we don't want to focus so much on the precision (that is, reducing the amount of false positives), but rather on the recall (that is, retrieving the largest amount of correct nodes). We also envision a reranking component that will be capable of highlighting the most important skills for a measure that could be defined externally (based, for instance, on the intrinsic value of various skills) or internally (if the user has mentioned related nodes multiple times).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On this premise, we focus our evaluation method on the recall@k, which is a metric that measures how many correct nodes are found within the top k classes. The precision@k, which tells us how many of the k retrieved nodes are correct, will be a secondary metric to consider to check how many false positives we retrieve, penalizing the use of larger sample sizes. The two metrics are summarized by the F-score@k. Each of these metrics could be further refined by considering the score to be inversely proportional to the rank in which the correct node is found. However, since our first iteration is not concerned with the rank, we will use a 0-1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of occupations, since our test set includes only one correct node per sentences, the recall@k reduces to understanding whether the correct node is within the first k elements. However, multiple skill nodes can correspond to a single sentence, so that the recall at k really captures what percentage of the correct skills on average is retrieved within the first k elements, as we take one sentence per data-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining our metrics.\n"

    "The result of the evaluation are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The results obtained without MMR are definitely better than the results obtained without MMR. This happens because the correct code is most of the times within the first k elements and still very similar to the first one. MMR excludes many good high ranking results that could be retrieved otherwise because they are too similar to the first result.\n",
    "2. Different retrieval functions return the same results. This probably happens because the Gecko embeddings are normalized so that l2, cosine similarity and dot product all determine the same ranking. We will choose the default version.\n",
    "3. The best embedding methods is PREFERREDLABEL, slightly higher than ALL_OCCUPATIONS in our k of interest (3 or 5). We are choosing PREFERREDLABEL given that it has a small margin over ALL_OCCUPATIONS and it's easier to implement as its value is already present in the dataset. We think that the information contained in such label helps the model identify the correct occupation even when they are not using the same words, as the correspondence between ESCO nodes and PREFERREDLABEL is one-to-one. On the other hand, a secondary labels can appear in multiple nodes, thus confusing the model."

In fact, there is an average of 27 essential skills for each occupation and the first experiment only retrieves a small number of them for k=1,3,5,10. Rather than retrieving large number of skills, we instead retrieve a small number of occupations in the second experiment and link them to their essential skills using the ESCO database. In this case, the recall results are much higher than in occupation linking. This is expected, since correct occupations imply correct related essential skills. However, the precision tends to decrease fast, as the number of skills increases by an average of 27k.

In case our query coincides with the title, this is probably the ground for the 5% recall boost when compared to the other fields. In the case of the synthetic query, however, we see how this is pretty similar to the description, so that most likely we gain from the similarity between the description of the experience and the description field in the node. \n",

This makes sense, as we get some advantages over the multiple secondary labels embeddings by avoiding flooding the database with the same embedding for multiple labels. This is also stably better than the combination of all fields, probably because the embeddings are more focused and the more descriptive queries can be matched to the description directly, while those that are focused on the title can be matched to either preferred or secondary labels.\n",
    "- When using the **title**, the method with three embeddings is more effective than all the others for low values of k. For higher values of k this doesn't hold anymore and the method with multiple embeddings has some gains as the titles are probably closer to each single preferred label. Since we don't care that most of the labels are not correct, this guarantees an advantage over the flooding of labels.\n",

    "In case of skills, we notice that lower values of k (1 and 3) correspond to a better performance of single field methods, while the recall of multiple field methods improves for higher values of k. This is possibly a consequence of the fact that skill labels have a more descriptive component than their occupation counterparts, so that when a smaller number of them are chosen, it's easier to confuse the (right) preferred label with a similar (wrong) secondary label or description. On the other hand, having many similar skills to choose from, for higher values of k the choice can be more forgiving and actually pick up secondary labels or descriptions of correct skills that are more similar to the synthetic queries than their preferred label. Notice how in this case, multiple (and not triple) embeddings are particularly advantageous for skills, probably because single secondary labels have less redundancy than in occupations."

    "An additional field that can be found in ESCO databases is the Scope Notes, whose purpose is to explain which use-cases are included or excluded for the particular ESCO node. We want to conduct experiments to verify whether the inclusion of this field change substantially the performance of our retrieval model. In particular, we run the previous experiments on the Hahu dataset for occupations, as the skill Scope Notes field has not been parsed at the time of writing. In particular we are interested in the following questions:\n",
    "1. Can we improve our model performance by including the entirety of the scope notes field? \n",

    "Before conducting the experiment, it is worth to note that in the Hahu dataset the following is true:\n",
    "- Only 61 out of 542 samples have a nonempty scopenote (11.25% of the dataset)\n",
    "- Only 47 out of 542 samples have an include component of the scopenote (8.67% of the dataset)\n",

    "Clearly the use of the multilanguage model on the analogous fields determines a similar recall loss to the one obtained with the embedding of all three fields. In other words, by controlling for secondary labels, we find out that the difference between the English and the multilingual embedding models is the same as before, although the absolute values are shifted by a couple of percentage points at every value of k. This shows that the multilingual model determines in fact a strong performance drop. Moreover, the addition of secondary labels to the French model guarantees a performance increase that is very similar to the one for the English model."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of our study has been to evaluate linking models to the Occupation and Skill ESCO taxonomies. We chose to do so by generating synthetic queries based on a dataset of 542 job descriptions with the corresponding ESCO code for the occupations and of 1054 sentences containing 2013 skills with the corresponding Tabiya UUID. Those synthetic queries are assumed to be similar to the input that an hypothetical user of the Brujula platform would submit. We also fixed the embedding model to be VertexAI's Gecko003.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first focused the evaluation on a selection of hyperparameters that would guarantee the maximum recall at various values of retrieved nodes k. We assumed that k would be decided in advance and that we would prioritize retrieving the ground truth within the first k documents (recall-based approach) rather than having most retrieved documents be the ground truth (precision-based approach). This would be the case because we could add a validation step in which the user would confirm which skills would be relevant to their experience. The hyperparameter we considered were \n",
    "* The score function (euclidean distance, scalar product or cosine similarity);\n",
    "* The usage of Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) or not to choose the top documents;\n",
    "* How to embed each node as a combination of the collection fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that both for the occupations and for the skills, it made no difference which score function should be used. Moreover, we found that most correct nodes could be found within the first few documents, so that using MMR would not be beneficial to our purpose. Finally we discovered that using only the preferred label guarantees a higher recall at all values of k, with the performance matched by using a combination of all fields for higher values of k. This happens most likely because the label encodes the core meaning of the job, even when it's not referred to directly. When given the possibility to make mistakes, the best match is sometimes more similar to the secondary labels (which are sometimes not unique) or to the description, which explains the result for higher k.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second evaluation involved understanding how to retrieve skills that are connected to a given occupation. A first naive approach involved linking the occupation synthetic queries to the skill database and calculating the recall using the essential skills related to the ground truth occupation as true values. This however, was not very efficient for our values of k as each occupation has an average of 27 related essential skills. Of the top 10 skills, less than 2 on average were included in these essential skills, so we decided to change approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach that yielded better results involved linking occupations first and then considering as predictions all the essential skills related to the occupations, compared to the ground truth of all the essential skills of the true occupation. It is clear that the recall of this method would be higher than the recall of the occupation linking evaluation, as a correctly retrieved occupation would guarantee that all its essential skills are correctly retrieved. However, the interesting component is seeing how wrongly retrieved occupations might have skills in common with the correct one, thus improving the overall recall of skills. This is indeed already the case for k=1, so that about half the essential skills are retrieved on average. For higher values of k, this leads to very large recall values at the expenses of the precision. We included the F-score to make sure we could choose the k that would maximizes this trade-off, which is a value between 1 and 3. The method could be further improved by adding a ranking system tha would present the most relevant skills for measures given outside of this experiment (such as relevance, transferability and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we were interested in understanding whether we would benefit from a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that would select subspans of the query to be linked to the occupation. We did so by linking only the titles and comparing their results to the ground truth, both for the occupation evaluation and for the essential skills of the second experiment. We found that indeed linking the title guarantees an increment in recall for low values of k, but that this gains tend to disappear for higher values of k. This suggests that we might benefit from a NER model if we decide to retrieve a lower number of elements. We also analyzed the residual elements in which the title linking failed and found out that linking the whole sentence to the description was more successful than linking it to the preferred label. We suggested for this reason that if a NER model were to be implemented, we could consider linking the retrieved subspan to the preferred label and the sentences in which no span is retrieved to a combination of all the fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another line of work consisted in studying whether strategies including multiple embeddings per node would yield better results than strategies including only one embedding. We restricted to the occupation evaluation and compared our previous results to a strategy embedding separately the three fields for preferred label, secondary labels and description and to another strategy embedding the preferred label, and description fields as well as all separate secondary label for each node. We found that the one with three embeddings outperforms both the highest performing single embedding strategy, as well as the one with multiple embeddings, both when linking the synthetic query and the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth experiment consisted in understanding how many documents we need to retrieve to guarantee to have the true positive for all of our samples in the test set. We run this experiment using the best retrieval function on occupation (three embeddings per node) and run into some technical issues that could not guarantee a 100% recall. However, we found that our upper bound was around k=82. This seems to imply that it is not feasible to analyze the top 82 elements with brute force, but we should probably find a strategy to rank our results after multiple questions to retrieve the correct one. Moreover, it might not be appropriate to assume that there is only one correct ESCO node for each user query, therefore we should investigate how to restrict to those that are relevant, which could be found in a much smaller number of tries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we focused on the evaluation of our embedding method on localised ESCO data for South Africa, seeing if the method could generalize to other dataset. We used a test set provided by the University of Oxford and consisting of 1549 SMS in which users replied to a question about their livelihood. Those replies were later identified with an ESCO code matching the data in a localised ESCO database for South Africa. We replicated our evaluation trying to observe if we could link the test set to the database, although we observed that the linking performance to the original ESCO database is very similar to the one for the localised ESCO. This could happen for a few reasons: either the data doesn't contain many samples linking to localised nodes, or the construction of the database doesn't reflect new knowledge included in the sample or finally because our linking methods are not sophisticated enough to pick up the differences. We verified that indeed 1450 out of the 1549 SMS are linking to localised ESCO nodes, so that the reason might be one of the other two. Since the development of a definitive South African localised ESCO is still underway, we refrain from conducting further evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we considered the evaluation of ESCO in the French language as a way to compare the regular gecko embedding model with its multilingual version. We found that the multilingual model determined a loss of recall of about 8% from the regular model, both in the general case of embedding all three fields of ESCO nodes, and in the case in which we removed secondary labels as they could be different for localised nodes. We found the difference to be the same in both cases, leading to determine that the multilingual embedding model has a worse predictive power than the English one. "
