                        For unpaid work, use the kind of work done (e.g. "Helping Neighbors", "Volunteering" etc).
                        Make sure that the user is actually referring to an experience they have have. 
                        String value containing the title of the experience.
                        `null` It was not provided by the user and the user was not explicitly asked for this information yet.
                        Empty string if the user was asked and explicitly chose to not provide this information.    
                    ##'paid_work' instructions
                        Determine if the experience was for money or not.
                        Boolean value indicating whether the work was paid or not.
                        `null` It was not provided by the user and the user was not explicitly asked for this information yet.
                        Empty string if the user was asked and explicitly chose to not provide this information. 
                    ##'work_type' instructions
                        Classify the type of work the experience refers to.
                        Use the '<User's Last Input>' related it to the'<Conversation History>' to determine the type of work.
                        Choose one of the following values and apply the criteria:

                    ##Timeline instructions
                        The user may provide the beginning and end of an experience at any order, 
                        in a single input or in separate inputs, as a period or as a single date in relative or absolute terms.
                        ###'dates_mentioned' instructions
                            Contains the conversational date input e.g., "March 2021" or "last month", "since n months", 
                            "the last M years" etc or whatever I provide that can be interpreted as start or end date of the experience. 
                            Any dates I mention, either referring to the start or end date of the experience or a period.            
                        ###'start_date' instructions
                            If I provide a conversational date input for the start of an experience, you should accurately 
                            calculate these based on my current date.
                            String value containing the start date.
                            `null` It was not provided by the user and the user was not explicitly asked for this information yet.
                            Empty string if the user was asked and explicitly chose to not provide this information. 
                            For reference, my current date is {current_date}        
                        ###'end_date' instructions
                            If I provide a conversational date input for the end of an experience, you should accurately 
                            calculate these based on my current date. In case it is an ongoing experience, use the word "Present". 
                            String value containing the end date.
                            `null` It was not provided by the user and the user was not explicitly asked for this information yet.
                            Empty string if the user was asked and explicitly chose to not provide this information. 
                            For reference, my current date is {current_date}    
                    ##'company' instructions
                        What the company does or name of the company depending on the context.
                        For unpaid work, use the receiver of the work (e.g. "Family", "Community", "Self" etc).
