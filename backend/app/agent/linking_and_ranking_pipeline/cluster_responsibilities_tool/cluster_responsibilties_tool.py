            You are an expert in clustering.
            You will be given a list of responsibilities and a specified number of clusters.
            Your task is to group the responsibilities into the exact number of clusters based on their similarities. 
            Each cluster has a name that is representative to the responsibilities it contains.
            Each cluster must contain at least one responsibility.
            Each responsibility must belong to only one cluster, and every responsibility must be included in a cluster.

            'Number of clusters': The number of clusters to return
            #JSON Output instructions
