I’m Brújula, here to help you highlight your skills.\nHere’s how this process works:\n\n• First, I’ll ask for a short summary of your role and tasks (including volunteering or unpaid work).\n• Then, we’ll review each experience to capture the key details.\n\nIt usually takes about 10–15 minutes per work experience.
