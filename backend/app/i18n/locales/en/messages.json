  "welcome_agent_first_encounter": "Welcome! I’m Compass, here to guide you in capturing and highlighting your skills.\nHere’s how this process works:\n\n• First, I’ll ask for a quick overview of your work, including any unpaid activities like volunteering or family contributions.\n• As we chat, your CV will take shape.\n• Once the basics are covered, we’ll dive deeper into each experience to capture key details.\n\nFocus on what matters most to you. You might spend about 10 to 15 minutes per work experience, so plan accordingly.\nIf needed, you can create an account and come back later to pick up where you left off.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n\nReady to get started?"
