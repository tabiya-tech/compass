    This class is responsible for managing the authentication of the users. It serves two main purposes:
    - Add the  security definitions for OpenAPI docs. We achieve on our api by using the HTTPBearer.
        To use you will need to add the function get_user_info in dependencies. If you don't want to get user info
        and just add only on the API docs you can use this class's object provider in the dependencies
        eg  `credentials = Depends(auth.provider)`
    - Get authenticated user. This is done by using the get_user_info
        function as a dependency in the route. the return value of this function is the user info.
