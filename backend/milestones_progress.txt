# milestones_progress.txt

Database Schema Design ✅ (DONE)
    ✓ Defined 11 collections across taxonomy_db, labor_demand_db, jobs_db
    ✓ Created Pydantic v2 models with validation (models.py - 850+ lines)
    ✓ Documented indexes, relationships, constraints
    ✓ Collection constants: TaxonomyCollections, LaborDemandCollections, JobsCollections
    Location: backend/app/taxonomy/models.py


Data Ingestion Scripts ✅ (DONE)
    ✓ esco_occupations_importer.py - Imported 3,062 ESCO occupations (99.6% success)
    ✓ esco_skills_importer.py - Imported 13,896 ESCO skills (100% success)
    ✓ esco_relations_importer.py - Imported 130,822 occupation-skill relations (100% success)
    ✓ kesco_importer.py - Imported 5,915 KeSCO occupations (99.9% success)
    ✓ config.py - Environment-based configuration with .env integration
    ✓ run_all_imports.py - Master orchestration script
    Total: 153,695 records imported in 3.5 minutes
    Database: compass-kenya-application-local (MongoDB Atlas)
    Location: backend/app/taxonomy/importers/


REST API Endpoints ❌ (NOT DONE) ⭐ NEXT: Build these first for immediate data access
    FastAPI routes to query occupations, skills, labor demand
    Priority endpoints:
      - GET /api/taxonomy/occupations (list with filters)
      - GET /api/taxonomy/occupations/{id} (single occupation)
      - GET /api/taxonomy/occupations/{id}/skills (skills for occupation)
      - GET /api/taxonomy/skills/{id}/occupations (occupations using skill)
      - GET /api/taxonomy/skills (list with search)
      - POST /api/taxonomy/occupations (add custom Kenyan occupation)
      - PATCH /api/taxonomy/occupations/{id} (update Kenya relevance flags)
      - GET /api/labor-demand/occupations/{id}?region={region} (demand data)
    Minimum: 8-10 endpoints specified in contract
    Location: backend/app/routers/taxonomy.py (to be created)


Job Scraping Infrastructure ❌ (NOT DONE)
    Base scraper class with common functionality
    6 platform-specific scrapers:
      - BrighterMonday
      - Fuzu
      - MyJobMag
      - JobsinKenya
      - Jobweb Kenya
      - Careerjet
    Proof of concept: scrape ≥10 jobs from each platform (60 jobs total)
    Store in jobs_db with proper taxonomy mapping
    Location: backend/app/scrapers/ (to be created)


Tests ❌ (NOT DONE)
    Unit tests for Pydantic models (validation, serialization)
    Integration tests for importers (DB operations)
    API endpoint tests (request/response validation)
    Scraper tests (mock responses, data extraction)
    Location: backend/tests/ (to be created)


Documentation ❌ (NOT DONE)
    API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI) - auto-generated by FastAPI
    Deployment runbook (environment setup, data migration)
    Architecture diagrams (system components, data flow)
    Location: backend/docs/ (to be created)


================================================================================
MILESTONE 1 PROGRESS: 30% Complete (Due: December 14, 2025)
================================================================================

COMPLETED:
  ✅ Database schemas (20%)
  ✅ Data ingestion (10%)

REMAINING:
  ⭐ REST API endpoints (30%) - START HERE
  ❌ Job scraping infrastructure (30%)
  ❌ Tests (5%)
  ❌ Documentation (5%)

NEXT ACTION: Build REST API endpoints to expose the 153,695 taxonomy records
             that were just imported. This enables immediate querying and 
             validation of the data, which is critical for demo/testing.

KNOWN ISSUES:
  - 1 ESCO occupation failed (row 3007: NaN in alt_labels) - minor, can fix later
  - 2 KeSCO occupations skipped as duplicates - investigate if needed
  - No write permissions on compass-taxonomy-dev database - using compass-kenya-application-local instead
