You asked me to describe a typical day at work, and I told you I get up, go to work, get a list of confectionary items to bake from my boss, work in the kitchen until I am done, and then go home. You asked me to tell you more about what I do in the kitchen. I told you I bake bread, cookies, and the occasional croissant. You asked me how I decide what to bake each day. I then decided I didn't want to talk about this anymore and asked to move on. You acknowledged my request and said you had all the information you needed. You then identified the following skills based on my responses: work according to recipe, follow production schedule, prepare bakery products, bake goods, and follow written instructions. You then asked me to describe a typical day as a professional guitarist. I told you I played what the band rehearsed, played as a group, read music sheets and played from those, and occasionally composed my own music. You acknowledged that this is an important part of being a musician, working together as a team. You then asked me to tell you more about what else I did at work. I told you I took care of my instruments. You asked me to tell you more about how I took care of my instruments. \n"
