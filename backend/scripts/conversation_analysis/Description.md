Based on behavioral milestones: Intro → Experience Discovery → Experience Exploration → Completed. Values are: <br><br>• **Group 1: Low Engagement** – User never left the intro phase or didn’t discover any experiences. These users were blocked for unknown reasons (not technical issues).<br>• **Group 2: Moderate Engagement** – User discovered at least one experience but did not explore any.<br>• **Group 3: High Engagement** – User started exploring one or more experiences but did not complete the conversation.<br>• **Group 4: Successful Engagement** – User explored all experiences and reached the end of the conversation.<br>• **Group 5: No Engagement** – User never started the conversation (e.g. didn’t accept terms or provide PII). This group cannot be contacted. |
