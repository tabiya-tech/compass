**Compass by Tabiya** is an AI chatbot designed to assist job-seekers in exploring and discovering their skills.

Compass has two objectives: 
- Populate a digital skill wallet that captures the experience of job-seekers, including the
skills inherent in their formal and informal work.
- By doing so, guide job-seekers in exploring and discovering
their skills and interests based on their lived experiences.
